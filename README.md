# Hey, I'm Soyeb 👋

Backend engineer who enjoys building **systems that are meant to grow**.

I work close to APIs, data, and infrastructure — designing systems that can be **tested under pressure, improved through iteration, and scaled with confidence**.  
I believe strong systems come from understanding limits, not avoiding them.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Designing and building **scalable backend systems**
- Developing **clean, well-documented APIs**
- Working with **databases, caches, and search engines**
- Building **AI-assisted workflows** 
- Iterating through **break → optimize → scale** cycles to reach stable designs
- Optimizing for **cost, latency, and operational reliability**

## 🧩 Engineering Principles I Value

- Simple systems scale better  
- Observability enables good decisions  
- Clear contracts beat hidden magic  
- Stability comes from iteration, not perfection

## ♟️ Outside Code

- Chess 
- Seasonal sports: running, swimming, badminton
- Random hobbies that rotate over time
- Binge-watching anime — occasionally and unapologetically
